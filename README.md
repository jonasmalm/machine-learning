# machine-learning
During the course [TDDE01: Machine Learning](https://liu.se/studieinfo/en/kurs/tdde01/ht-2020), I learned the basics of machine learning in the fall off 2020. In this repo, I included some R-code I wrote during the course.

# neuralnet.R
In this file I create a neural network that predicts sin(x) from x. There is also some code to manually calculate the output of each layer using the sigmoid activation function.
